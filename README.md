# data-contracts-runner

Canonical shared runner contract surface for Data Contracts.

This repository owns non-implementation-specific runner docs/specs and provides a front-facing entrypoint for all runners.

Runner implementations remain implementation-owned:
- `dc-runner-rust`
- `dc-runner-python`
- `dc-runner-php`

Canonical shared specs live under `/specs/07_runner_behavior/`.
