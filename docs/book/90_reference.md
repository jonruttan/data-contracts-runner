# Reference

## When to read this

Read this for direct path references to canonical shared runner surfaces.

## What you will do

Locate exact files for shared contracts, policy, governance, and guides.

## Step-by-step

1. Use `/docs/book/reference_index.md` for ordered chapter links.
2. Use `/specs/index.md` for spec ownership map.
3. Use `/specs/04_governance/check_sets_v1.yaml` for repo checks.

## Common failure signals

- paths in reference index that do not exist.
- missing ownership docs for shared vs impl-specific surfaces.

## Normative refs

- `/specs/index.md`
- `/docs/book/reference_index.md`
- `/specs/04_governance/check_sets_v1.yaml`
